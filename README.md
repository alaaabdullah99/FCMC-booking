# FCMC-booking
Nowadays, digital transformation is the most important transformation in this generation, the Family 
Community Medicine Center aims to be a part of this transfer. The online patient appointment improves 
the FCMC efficiency, instead of physically having to go to the center to book an appointment or open a 
file. All of these can be done on the internet. The patient appointment booking online serves the staff 
and students of Imam Abdulrahman Bin Faisal University where they all can book an appointment, edit 
it if needed, or open a new file in the center. The idea of this service came up since covid-19 to help with 
social distance, mobility, and so on. By digitalizing these services, Family Community Medicine Center 
will save much time and resources to work on other developments for their patients.
